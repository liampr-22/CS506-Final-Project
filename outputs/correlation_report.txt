FOOD ATLAS vs FEEDING AMERICA: MULTI-YEAR CORRELATION REPORT
Dataset Validation via Time-Lagged Comparison (2010-2019)
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis validates the alignment between two independent sources of food insecurity data across multiple time points using a time-lagged methodology:
 • USDA Food Access Research Atlas (structural/access metrics)
 • Feeding America Map the Meal Gap (outcome/insecurity rate)

The analysis confirms a consistently **strong positive correlation** between the **Poverty Rate** (Atlas) and the **Food Insecurity Rate** (FA) across all tested year pairs, validating the combined use of these datasets for modeling.

DATASET DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Food Atlas (Available Years): 2010, 2015, 2019 (Census Tract Level)
Feeding America (Available Years): 2014, 2015, 2017 (County Level)

Comparison Strategy: Time-Lagged Correlation (Atlas structural data compared to nearest FA outcome data).

Matched County Analysis: 
 • N=2,825 counties (2015 Direct Match)
 • Average Matched N across all pairs: Approximately 2,800 counties.

CORRELATION RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total comparisons analyzed: 12 (4 metrics across 3 year pairs)

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consistency of Correlation Strength (Across all three time points):
 • Strong (|r| > 0.7): 3 comparisons (Poverty Rate)
 • Moderate (0.5 < |r| ≤ 0.7): 0 comparisons
 • Weak (|r| ≤ 0.5): 9 comparisons

✓ STRONG ALIGNMENT: The correlation between **Poverty Rate** (Atlas) and **Food Insecurity Rate** (FA) remains **strong ($r > 0.7$)** and highly significant across all three tested time points. This consistency confirms that the datasets are fundamentally aligned on the primary economic driver of food insecurity.

INSIGHT: The weak correlations for LILA, SNAP, and LAPOP are consistent across years, indicating that the two datasets continue to measure different aspects: FA measures **outcome (insecurity)**, while these Atlas metrics measure **structural access and resource presence**.
