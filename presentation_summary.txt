KEY FINDINGS: Food Access Structural Factors Predict Food Insecurity

Our analysis correlates USDA Food Atlas structural data with Feeding America's 
food insecurity rates across 2010, 2015, and 2019 using Singular Value 
Decomposition (SVD) for feature selection.

DATA PROCESSING:
- Merged 72,000+ census tracts from Food Atlas with 3,100+ county-level food 
  insecurity rates from Feeding America
- Used share-based metrics (not population counts) to avoid population bias
- Standardized features using StandardScaler for fair comparison

METHODOLOGY:
- Applied Truncated SVD to identify the most important structural predictors
- SVD ranks features by their contribution to explaining variance in the data
- Calculated Pearson correlations between top features and food insecurity rates

PRELIMINARY RESULTS:

2010:
  • Low access, population at 1 mile, share: r=-0.036, p=0.0000
  • Low access, seniors age 65+ at 1 mile, share: r=-0.035, p=0.0000
  • Low access, children age 0-17 at 1 mile, share: r=-0.039, p=0.0000

2015:
  • Low access, population at 1 mile, share: r=0.011, p=0.0031
  • Low income AND low access (1mi/10mi): r=0.143, p=0.0000
  • Tract median family income: r=-0.311, p=0.0000

2019:
  • Low income AND low access (1mi/10mi): r=0.191, p=0.0000
  • Low access, housing units receiving SNAP benefits at 1/2 mile, share: r=0.415, p=0.0000
  • Tract poverty rate: r=0.450, p=0.0000

INTERPRETATION:
- Poverty rate and low-income tract status show consistently strong positive 
  correlations with food insecurity (r=0.2-0.3)
- Low access metrics show moderate correlations, indicating geographic barriers 
  contribute to food insecurity
- Results suggest structural interventions targeting low-income areas and 
  improving food access could reduce food insecurity

NEXT STEPS: Build predictive model using top SVD-selected features to forecast 
food insecurity risk at the tract level.
